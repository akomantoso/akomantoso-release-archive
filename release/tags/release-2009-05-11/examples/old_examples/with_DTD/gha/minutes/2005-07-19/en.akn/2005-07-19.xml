                            <p>asked the Minister for Education and
                                Sports the organic relations between the Ghana National Association
                                of Teachers (GNAT) and the National Association of Graduate Teachers
                                (NAGRAT) in pursuance of the professional and trade union rights of
                                teachers in the country. and trade union rights of teachers in the
                                country, because the two are not the same. And in his Answer, he
                                referred to professional rights of both members. Does it mean that
                                the NAGRAT has no trade union rights as his Answer states? Because,
                                the two are not the same. Professional rights are different from
                                trade</p>
                        </question>

                            <from>Mr. Osafo-Maafo</from>
                            <p>Mr. Speaker, GNAT was the only umbrella professional body for
                                teachers in the country until when some graduate teachers started
                                agitation for recognition and finally broke away and formed the
                                National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT). </p>
                            <p> Currently, there are two (2) associations serving the interest of
                                teachers in the GES. Whereas members of NAGRAT consist of a section
                                of graduate teachers, GNAT covers nongraduates as well as graduate
                                teachers.</p>
                            <p> The professional rights of both members of GNAT and NAGRAT are
                                assured as outlined in the Conditions and Scheme of Service for
                                teachers. In the event, where a member of the Service has a problem,
                                he approaches the association to which he belongs and that
                                association handles the problem with GES in the light of the
                                Conditions of Service.</p>
                            <p> In the area of professional development, GNAT organizes in-service
                                training for its members.</p>
                            <p> Mr. Speaker, GNAT joins the ‘FORUM’ comprising the Judicial Service
                                Staff Association of Ghana (JUSSAG), the Registered Nurses
                                Association (GRNA) and the Civil Servants Association (CSA) for the
                                negotiation of salaries for all teachers.</p>
