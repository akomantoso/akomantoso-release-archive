        Generic elements 
        Comment: All elements in this schema fall under one of five
        content models: hierarchical container, container, block, inline 
        and mark. Besides named elements, the schema also provides for a 
        generic element for each of them, that can be used for markup that 
        fits the content models but can be specified by a precise name that 
        is not used in this schema. The 'name' attribute must be used for 
        naming the element. 
        It is also a characteristic of this schema that all named elements 
        are equivalent, and can be substituted to, the corresponding generic 
        element with their name as the value of the name attribute. Thus, by 
        definition, &lt;p> = &lt;block name="p">, &lt;part> = &lt;hcontainer name="part">, 
        &lt;act> = &lt;container name="act">, etc.
