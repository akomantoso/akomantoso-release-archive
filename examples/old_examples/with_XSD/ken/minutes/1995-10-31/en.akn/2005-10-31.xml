						</ul>
					</question>
					<answer by="Criticos" as="AMH">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</p>
						<ul id="ul5">
							<li>
								<p>It is not true that during the year 1994/95 drugs, medical
									supplies and various equipment amounting to over Kshs13 million
									were stolen from Migori District Hospital.</p>
								<p>But I am aware that during this period drugs worth Kshs22,000
									were stolen from the drug store of the hospital. Investigations
									carried out led to the arrest of three hospital staff, who have
									been charged and the case is pending before Migori Senior
									Magistrate's Court.</p>
								<p>I am also aware that electric calculators worth Kshs2,900 and a
									typewriter worth Kshs59,800 were stolen. The reports were made
									to the Migori Police Station but to date no arrests or
									recoveries have been made. </p>
								<p>In April 1995, a new photocopier worth Kshs289,000 was stolen and
									investigations by police officers led to the arrest of four
									hospital staff and recovery of the photocopier. The officers
									have been charged and the Ministry interdicted them. The case is
									still pending before the court. </p>
								<p>The watchman who was on duty has since been charged and the case
									is pending before Migori court. The total value of all these
									stolen items is Kshs455,190.</p>
							</li>
							<li>The measures the Ministry has taken to curb the thefts are:- 
								<ul id="ul6">
									<li>The institution of strict control measures on delivery,
										storage and issuing of drugs, medical supplies and
										equipment.</li>
									<li>The hospital has now been fenced.</li>
									<li>The drug store has been burglar-proofed.</li>
									<li>The staff suspected of being involved in thefts have been
										reshuffled.</li>
									<li>The County Council staff who were staying in the hospital
										compound premises have been removed.</li>
									<li>The Administration Police Officers have been deployed to
										guard the hospital compound.</li>

					<speech by="Smith" as="S">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Just before I allow Members to ask supplementary questions, Mr.
							Assistant Minister, you said in part (a) that there are some cases in
							court. Do you have the case numbers and who are the parties?</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Criticos">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not <span class="unknown">Mr. Criticos</span> have the relevant information
							regarding the parties concerned but, obviously, it is the Ministry of
							Health versus the culprits.</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Achola">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister has tried to hide some
							of the facts by understating the actual amount involved. He has only
							talked about Kshs450,000, but my records show that over Kshs13 million
							has been stolen. Could the Assistant Minister inform the House as to
							what exactly is going on? When will these people be charged and what is
							the case number of the people involved? The thefts in Migori hospital
							have been going on for a long time and nothing seems to be happening.
							Thieves are being recycled, as he puts it, and this is not good enough
							for our people.</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Criticos">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to ask the hon. Member to give me
							a copy of his records which indicate theft of equipment worth Kshs13
							million. I really would like that information because we, in the
							Ministry, are not aware. Secondly, about the reshuffling of the people,
							we cannot discharge people from the service of the Ministry when they
							have not been caught red-handed and when there is no evidence against
							them by which they can be charged in court. So, if there is any doubt,
							we try and move them to other areas because they have not been proven
							guilty. Therefore, we cannot assume someone is guilty.</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Aluoch">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the answer given by the Assistant Minister, part
							(v) states that the County Council staff who are staying in the hospital
							compound premises have been removed. This is misleading the House. Only
							last Monday, we were attending a DDC meeting and we were discussing when
							the County Council staff will leave the hospital compound because, this
							is what is contributing to the thefts as well. </p>
						<p>The Chairman of the County Council is still there, the Clerk to the
							Council and the rest of the Council staff are occupying the houses that
							the hospital staff should be using. They cannot even install an X-ray
							machine because the council staff are still in the compound. What are
							you going to do to remove them instead of telling us that they are not
							there? Stop misleading this House!</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Criticos">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not aware that the County Council is using
							Ministry of Health houses. If the hon. Member can furnish us with the
							names of the people concerned, the Ministry will then take the
							appropriate action to evict them.</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Nthenge">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Do you not agree with me that the
							hon. Member has told the Assistant Minister even the titles of the
							people occupying these houses? One is the Town Clerk, the other one is
							the Chairman of the County Council. What other information does he
						need?</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Smith" as="S">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> I agree with you!</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Criticos">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I got two names; the Town Clerk and the Chairman of
							the County Council. I do not know whether these are the only ones or
							there are others. I was just asking about the others. You have my
							assurance that those people will be evicted immediately.</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Achola">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think I would like the Assistant Minister
							to assure this House that something is going to be done to stop the
							theft of drugs from Migori Hospital. Even the local pharmacies around
							are selling, in broad daylight, drugs from Government Stores and nothing
							is being done about that. The police are not arresting anybody. What are
							you going to do, Mr. Assistant Minister?</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Criticos">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said, on numerous occasions, that we would like
							support from the local community. They should also keep a watchful eye
							on these people. I have given you six measures that we have taken to
							stop the theft of drugs. However, the local community and the medical
							board which is there should also be actively involved in looking after
							our drugs because they belong to us in general.</p>

					<title>COMMISSIONING OF HEALTH CENTRE</title>
					<question by="Moiben" to="MH">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p>Mr. Moiben asked the Minister for Health</p>
						<ul id="ul7">
							<li>when Saboti Health Centre will be operational and officially opened;
								and,</li>
							<li>when the Health Centre will be supplied with electricity.</li>
						</ul>
					</question>
					<answer as="AMH" by="Criticos">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</p>
						<ul id="ul8">
							<li>My Ministry intended to complete and operationalize Saboti Health
								Centre during the 1994/95 financial year. However, due to the
								inadequate funds and escalation of the costs over the period of 1991
								- 93, the project could not be completed as planned and it is about
								95 per cent complete. The project period expired and, hence, there
								is no provision in the current financial year for the remaining
								funds to be allocated. My Ministry is in the process of obtaining
								funds to fully complete and equip the health centre, after which it
								will be operational and officially opened.</li>
							<li>Within the present contract for the health centre, there is a
								provision for a generator which should be adequate to provide
								electricity for <span class="unknown">The Assistant Minister for Health</span> the services
								that will require electricity. Electricity will, therefore, be
								supplied to the health centre as soon as funds for the installation
								of generators are provided.</li>
						</ul>
					</answer>
					<speech by="Moiben">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Trans-Nzoia DDC approved that electricity be
							supplied to this hospital way back in 1991. Can the Assistant Minister
							confirm when this will be done? The hospital was 95 per cent completed
							way back in 1991.</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Criticos">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, like I said earlier, when the funds are allocated,
							this will be done. We cannot supply electricity without funds.</p>

						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</p>
						<ul id="ul10">
							<li>Trade loan facilities have already been extended to the people of

							<li>Over 200 traders have received such loans between 1988 and

						</ul>
					</answer>
					<speech by="Nyagah">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the year 2000, there will be 33 million people in
							Kenya. To alleviate rural-urban migration, we need to look after that
							group that lives in the rural areas so that they do not feel the need to
							move into the urban areas. How much of that money was given to the 200
							people between 1988 and 1995, given the fact that the Government
							provision for this, in any given year, is not more than K£250,000? If
							you were to divide that per province, each province is entitled to less
							than K£62,500?</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Barmasai">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, it really depends on what the hon. Member refers to

						<p>Odoo-Buyangu-Ekero Road was approved by the Kakamega District Development

						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that funny reply from the Assistant

					<answer as="AMS" by="Sunkuli">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise for not having answered the Question

						<p>I am aware that on 2nd June, 1995 and not on the 20th May, 1995,
							Councillor Abdi Sole of Asako Location in company of other councillors,
							assistant chief Mohammed Farah Wachu and home guards were attacked by

					</answer>
					<speech by="Kofa">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not received the written reply, but if I
							listened carefully to the reply to part "b" of my Question, the
							Assistant Minister said "the chief and the home guards were in normal
							security patrol of the area". That means that the Assistant Minister has
							accepted that they got into problems while they were on duty. This
							councillor is maimed and can no longer fend for this family. Can the
							Assistant Minister confirm therefore that this maimed councillor and the
							two home guards that were killed will be compensated and could he tell

						<p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Assistant Minister for the

					<speech by="Farah">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> Arising from the answer given by the Assistant Minister earlier in which
							he said that home guards are issued with fire arms under the Firearms
							Act which is not true because there is no provision in the Firearms Act
							to create militia. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House why we
							cannot have a crack anti-banditry squad which is saved and that is in a
							position to track down this bandits on foot instead of putting the lives
							of innocent Kenyans who do not have proper training at risk whereby they
							are killed by bandits.</p>
					</speech>
					<speech by="Sunkuli">
						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> I hope hon. Farah is not actually implying that where he comes from they

						<from>Mr. Kofa</from>
						<p> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That undertaking was given by the

							Could he tell us how much longer he needs to be given for him to select
							very modest young men from the existing forces who are Somalis,
							Turkanas, Masais or Pokots; people who are used to doing that kind of

							<li>I have quite a long answer because this involves the life of a

								Hospital Maternity Ward on 4th June, 1995 with obstructed labour.
								She had been in labour for a very long time at home and was only
								brought to the hospital after failing to deliver since the baby was
								too big and was lying in a breach position. She was prepared for
								caesarian section operation which was carried out a few hours later
								on the morning of 5th June, 1995. Post operatively, she developed
								bacterial infection due to prolonged obstructed labour at home. She
								was also diagnosed to have malaria. Despite antibiotics and
								anti-malaria treatment, her condition deteriorated and she died on
